# Delhi-Metro-App
This program assists Delhi Metro commuters by calculating the fare and shortest route between a source and destination station. It also includes a metro map for better navigation.

### Implementation
- Graph Structure: Nodes represent metro stations with details such as name, corridor, and connected lines. Edges represent the distance between stations.
- Algorithms: Uses Dijkstra's algorithm, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS) to find the shortest path and calculate the fare based on the total distance.

### Features
1. Shortest Path Calculation: Determines the shortest distance and route between two stations.
2. Time Calculation: Computes time, based on the total distance of the shortest path.
3. Route Display: Shows the route from the source to the destination.
4. Metro Map: Provides a map for navigation.

### User Interaction

- Input: User enters source and destination station names.
- Output: Displays the shortest route, distance and time.

### Summary

This program uses advanced algorithms and data structures to provide Delhi Metro users with essential travel information, including routes and fares, ensuring an efficient and informed commute.
